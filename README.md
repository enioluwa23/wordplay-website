# wordplay-website

[Wordplay](https://github.com/enioluwa23/wordplay) is a Python package I created as a programmatic solution to filtering sets of strings based on literary criteria. It is applicable in the analysis of datasets such as emails, passwords, etc. 

I built this website to serve as an example of one of its many applications - looking up Scrabble words (err, not during a game, cause that would be cheating ðŸ˜‰). 

Built with [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), serving data from a [Flask](https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/) API server.
